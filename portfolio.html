                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>SleepOutside is the team project I worked on Throughout the semester with my team members. It is a camping online store, Where you can get goods such as backpacks, tents and sleeping bags. The following will walk you through both team project experience as well as individual tasks performed on Trello.</p>
                <p></p>
                
                <h3>Team projects</h3>
                <p>Throughout the semester, I had the opportunity to work with an amazing team! This team is built up of 4 individuals Camila, Weylin, Aaron, and myself. Each week we worked on a different challenge learning and helping each other manage the complex problems. By working with these awesome individuals, I learned the importance of asking questions and being willing to listen to how others think through problem-solving. I learn humility, and willingness to ask for everyone to slow down because I don't understand something. I learned to watch and found great joy being able to work with him outside of weekly projects as problems appeared.</p>
                <p> I felt that the most valuable part of this class was learning how to work as a team, I learned how to be invested in my teammates, and want my teammates to succeed, as well as feeling love and support from my teammates, wanted me to succeed. I learned the value of a second pair of eyes, and sometimes the third, these different perspectives often showed me where I was overthinking or where I was missing crucial parts of my program. I was also able to learn that everyone has their own strengths, and while some weeks I felt like I had no idea what we were doing and martinis helped me other weeks. I found that my teammates did not know what we were doing, and I had the answers. I although the principles talking this class are very important. I felt that the most important was learning how to work and learn as a team.</p>

            <h1>First Aid</h1>

            <div>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This website is designed to help people who want to learn the basics of first aid. The page is broken up into three segments Level 1 level 2 and level 3. I have grown up in a household full of medical professionals from my great grandfather, my grandmother, my mother, and my dad I've had the wonderful opportunity of learning the value of understanding how to take care of those in need. Although simple, I hope the information within this webpage can be helpful for those wishing to learn the basics of first aid.</p>
                <p>Level 1 consists of Every day, first aid treatments, such as cuts and scrapes and burns.</p>
                <p>Level 2 consists of more serious accidents, such as CPR and Fractures.</p>
                <p>Level 3 consists of trauma, first aid knowledge, I considered This to be the most important level, because the trauma training is something that is both simple yet will save a life. It is very likely in your lifetime you will need to use one of these techniques at some point in your life. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <p>The first aide webpage Consists of a homepage that introduces users to the website. The page consists of different levels of learning for first aid, all the content within these different levels are pulled from a local json file and displayed on the screen, and all Videos are being pulled from YouTube. I utilized local storage to allow users to select the videos they wish to watch later and add it to their watch list. Users can go back to their own watch list at any time and watch the videos. When the users are done, they have can select finished, and the video will remove itself from their list.</p>
                <h4>Lessons learned </h4>
                <p>I first created a design for this project, which was very helpful, I then attempted to create the website using functionality I understood and then try to improve in advance it after the fundamentals were done. JavaScript file used Work and perform their function, but I struggled to change the individual functions into one exportable function. This is a feature I intend to look back on and try to develop. The Problem I was running into who was my function would not properly call the json file and i struggled to identify why.</p>
                <p>I also struggled to understand how to optimize my YouTube videos too take up less space when trying to load to the screen. I intend on looking more into that and optimizing load time.</p>
                <p>I felt that overall it was a lot of fun to work on making this type of a webpage, this is a project I intend to move forward with, and add more levels and more information to better educate myself and others. </p>
