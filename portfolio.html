                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>SleepOutside is the team project I worked on Throughout the semester with my team members. It is a camping online store, Where you can get goods such as backpacks, tents and sleeping bags. The following will walk you through both team project experience as well as individual tasks performed on Trello.</p>

                <h3>Team projects</h3>
                <p>Throughout the semester, I had the opportunity to work with an amazing team! This team is built up of 4 individuals Camila, Weylin, Aaron, and myself. Each week we worked on a different challenge learning and helping each other manage the complex problems. By working with these awesome individuals, I learned the importance of asking questions and being willing to listen to how others think through problem-solving. I learn humility, and willingness to ask for everyone to slow down because I don't understand something. I learned to watch and found great joy being able to work with him outside of weekly projects as problems appeared.</p>
                <p> I felt that the most valuable part of this class was learning how to work as a team, I learned how to be invested in my teammates, and want my teammates to succeed, as well as feeling love and support from my teammates, wanted me to succeed. I learned the value of a second pair of eyes, and sometimes the third, these different perspectives often showed me where I was overthinking or where I was missing crucial parts of my program. I was also able to learn that everyone has their own strengths, and while some weeks I felt like I had no idea what we were doing and martinis helped me other weeks. I found that my teammates did not know what we were doing, and I had the answers. I although the principles talking this class are very important. I felt that the most important was learning how to work and learn as a team.</p>
